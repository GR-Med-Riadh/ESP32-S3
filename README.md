# ESP32-S3
4 layer pcb design of esp32-s3 board

JLCPCB is a company that constructs PCBs and prints 3D mechanical designs, they give us great offers with cheap prices for high quality precision PCBs. I would like to thank JLCPCB for their sponsorship and for supporting me in creating and innovating schematics, and improving my PCBs designs.

Everyone can create a pcb board but it's too hard to improve it.This pcb is a 4 layer pcb design of esp32-s3 board, ESP32-s3 is designed for Artificial Intelligence Of Things applications

 AIOT is the combination of Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations,improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics.

 ESP32-s3 is a dual-core XTensa LX7 MCU, capable of running at 240 MHz. Apart from its 512 KB of internal SRAM, it also comes with integrated 2.4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity that provides long-range support. It has 45 programmable GPIOs and supports a rich set of peripherals.it supports larger, high-speed octal SPI flash, and PSRAM with configurable data and instruction cache.

This PCB contains 2 micro-usb, the first one for UART communication with computers and the second one for OTG.
Now,itâ€™s time to talk about board design. 4-layer PCBs are printed circuit boards that have four conductive layers: the top layer, two inner layers, and the bottom layer. Both inner layers are the core, usually used as power or ground planes, while the top and bottom outer layers are for placing components and routing signals.
top layer: signal+VCC
inner 1 : ground
inner 2: ground
bottom layer: signal+VCC
